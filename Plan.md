Below is a revised and consolidated plan that integrates all the previous ideas with the new additions for multi-device type detection (e.g., cameras, IoTs, printers, mobile phones), model identification, and OS detection. The plan is structured logically to ensure a smooth development process while enhancing functionality, usability, and intelligence.
Consolidated Plan for Network Management Enhancements
Phase 1: Foundation â€“ Device Synchronization and Management

Objective: Build a robust data model and management system to synchronize device information across UIs, with support for detailed device type, model, and OS detection.

Tasks:

    Device Class Definition:
        Core attributes: IP, MAC, hostname, ports, ping, uptime, credentials, methods, device type, name, owner, whitelist status.
        Extended attributes:
            last_seen timestamp for activity tracking.
            status_history (e.g., last 10 pings/uptimes) for trend analysis.
            tags (e.g., "critical", "guest", "IoT") for categorization.
            New: device_category (e.g., camera, IoT, printer, mobile), model (e.g., "Canon PIXMA", "Nest Cam"), and os (e.g., "Android 14", "Embedded Linux").
    DeviceManager Enhancements:
        Implement sync_with_scan to merge scan results with existing devices, avoiding duplicates (using IP/MAC).
        Add real-time notify mechanism (e.g., signals) to update UIs.
        Securely store credentials (e.g., using keyring or encrypted fields).
        Use SQLite for scalable data persistence with versioning support.
    Device Detection:
        Flag unknown MACs/IPs as "new" and log first appearance.
        New: Integrate multi-device fingerprinting:
            Use DHCP options, MAC OUI lookups, SNMP, and Nmap for OS/service detection.
            Identify device categories (e.g., cameras, IoTs, printers, mobiles) and specific models where possible.

Why? This creates a scalable, secure foundation with rich device metadata for advanced features.
Phase 2: UI Refactoring and Enhanced Device Visualization

Objective: Modularize the UI for usability and display detailed device metadata for better interaction.

Tasks:

    SSH Popout (SSHDialog):
        Move SSH functions (paramiko, netmiko, pexpect, napalm) to a dialog.
        Add an interactive terminal with auto-login using Device.credentials.
        Support SSH key authentication (e.g., .pem files).
        Include a "Command History" tab per device.
    Ports Popout (PortsDialog):
        Move port selection to a dialog with curated (COMMON_PORTS) and custom lists.
        Add "Scan Common Ports" for auto-detection and a search/filter bar.
        Save port profiles (e.g., "Web Server": [80, 443]) in DeviceManager.config.
    Monitored Devices UI Enhancements:
        Add "Monitor Device" to SwissArmyKnifeUI right-click menu.
        Sync with scan results/history, showing adapter info (e.g., "eth0: 192.168.1.0/24").
        New: Display device_category, model, and os in the device list.
        Add "Sync with Adapter" button for dynamic network refresh.
    General UI Improvements:
        Implement a searchable "Device Quick Access" bar.
        Add a dark mode toggle for accessibility.

Why? Enhances usability and provides a clear, detailed view of the network, including device specifics.
Phase 3: AI Integration and Advanced Device Classification

Objective: Leverage AI to analyze full device data, classify devices, and automate tasks with context-aware logic.

Tasks:

    AI Updates:
        Update AITrainer and AIPredictor to use all Device attributes (including device_category, model, os).
        Train multi-class classifiers for device types (e.g., "Camera", "Printer") and regression models for ping/uptime predictions.
        Add AI monitoring thread to MonitoredDevicesUI.
    Advanced Classification:
        New: Detect specific models (e.g., "iPhone 14" vs. "Samsung Galaxy") and OS versions using behavioral patterns and fingerprinting data.
        Display "Confidence Scores" (e.g., "Camera: 95%") for predictions.
        Use unsupervised clustering (e.g., K-Means) to group devices by behavior (ports, ping patterns) and detect anomalies.
    Automation:
        Implement a "Rules Engine" for user-defined actions (e.g., "If ping > 100ms, WOL").
        Add "Dry Run" mode to simulate AI actions.
        Auto-WOL for offline non-whitelisted devices, checking status_history to avoid unnecessary wakes.
        New: Context-aware actions (e.g., firmware updates for printers, security scans for IoTs).
    UI Integration:
        Add "AI Status" column (e.g., "Normal", "Anomaly") with color coding.
        Include a "Resolve" button for anomalies (e.g., whitelist, scan).

Why? Combines powerful AI insights with automation tailored to device specifics, improving network management.
Phase 4: Speed, Resource Monitoring, and Predictive Analytics

Objective: Monitor performance and predict issues with device-specific responses.

Tasks:

    Speed Tests:
        Enhance run_speed_test for internet speed and add LAN speed tests (e.g., iperf3).
        Log results in DeviceManager with timestamps and display trends in a popout graph.
    Resource Monitoring:
        Use SNMP (if available) and SSH for lightweight polling (e.g., CPU, memory via top).
        Set user-defined thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%) for alerts.
        Cache data locally to reduce overhead.
    Predictive Analytics:
        New: Train AI on status_history and resource data to predict issues (e.g., slowdowns, failures).
        Trigger early warnings via notifications.
    Automation:
        Implement remote reboot with a 30s countdown dialog on high load/poor performance.
        Add "Scheduled Reboot" for persistent issues.

Why? Provides proactive performance management with predictive capabilities, tailored to device types.
Phase 5: Final Touches and Comprehensive Integration

Objective: Polish the system with user-friendly features and robust testing.

Tasks:

    Manual Device Access:
        Support manual login via RDP, AnyDesk, RustDesk, with credential autofill.
        Add a "Custom Command" option (e.g., putty -ssh <ip>).
    Alerts and Notifications:
        Integrate desktop notifications (e.g., via plyer) for critical events.
        Add an "Alert Log" tab with timestamps.
    Documentation and Reporting:
        Include an in-app "Help" dialog with tips and hotkeys.
        Generate PDF network state reports (devices, stats, anomalies).
    Testing and Debugging:
        Add "Verbose Mode" for detailed logs.
        Write unit tests for DeviceManager and AI functions.

Why? Ensures a polished, reliable, and user-centric experience.
